title: Mac Setup for iTerm2
---
As a developer, we are going to be spending a lot of time on command-line. So it is a good idea to use a better tool. iTerm2 is the choice.

## Download and Install
download : [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com)
install  : drag and drop the iTerm app into Appllactions folder

## Setup iTerm2
we like to use colorful command-line. Download from [iTerm2 Color Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/schemes).
I'd like to clone all the schemes, and choice one the like best.

``` bash
